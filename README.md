# 🧸 Maven Fuzzy Factory - Data Analytics Project

This project is the final capstone for my 4-month **Data Analyst course** at the *Institute of Emerging Careers*. The goal was to analyze a simulated e-commerce business dataset and derive meaningful insights to support decision-making and improve business performance.

## 📁 Project Overview

**Maven Fuzzy Factory** is a fictional online toy store. As a data analyst, my role was to:

- Set up and analyze the company's database
- Uncover trends in product sales and customer behavior
- Recommend strategies to improve conversions and profitability
- Visualize findings with dashboards and reports

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data extraction, transformation, and analysis  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation  
- **Maven Analytics Dataset** – Provided by Maven Analytics for simulation

## 📌 Key Insights & Deliverables

### 📊 Business Trends
- Sharp increase in conversion rate: from ~3% (2012) to 8.7% (2015)
- YOY growth across major products, especially **Mr. Fuzzy** and **Love Bear**
- Seasonality observed for **Love Bear** around Valentine's Day

### 🌐 Traffic Analysis
- **Gsearch** drives the most sessions but moderate conversion
- **Bsearch** has the highest conversion rate — recommends increased bidding
- **Socialbook** has low traffic and poor conversion

### 💡 Landing Page Performance
- `saw_lander_5`: Highest conversion rate (10.17%) with low traffic
- `saw_lander_1` and `saw_lander_3`: High bounce rates and low conversions — needs optimization

### 💵 Profitability
- Average profit margin: ~63–64%
- Refund rate: 5% — reducing this can improve customer retention and profits

## 📈 Recommendations

- **Launch new products** to capitalize on the upward sales trend  
- **Optimize landing pages** with high bounce/low conversion  
- **Target seasonal demand** with campaigns starting mid-January  
- **Improve quality** through customer feedback to reduce refund rates
